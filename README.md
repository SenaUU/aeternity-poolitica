# 🌟 Aeternity Poolitica - Community-Governed Yield Pool

**Democratizing DeFi: Earn yield, shape strategy, and vote your way to smarter finance.**

A decentralized application (DApp) built for the Aeternity hackathon that allows users to deposit AE tokens into a shared pool, vote on yield strategies, and earn returns based on community decisions.

## 🌱 Inspiration

Traditional wealth management is opaque, centralized, and exclusive — only a few decide how funds are invested. DeFi promised transparency and open access, but it often became a passive experience: users stake, earn, and leave.

We asked ourselves:

> *"What if yield farming felt more like participating in a democracy than betting in a casino?"*

That idea became **Poolitica** — a platform where contributors **earn yield and vote** on how the shared pool's funds are allocated. Every wallet becomes a voice in the community's collective financial intelligence.

## 🚀 Features

- **Deposit & Withdraw**: Users can deposit and withdraw AE tokens from the shared pool
- **Weighted Voting**: Vote on three strategies (Safe, Risky, Charity) with voting power proportional to deposits
- **Strategy Execution**: Execute the winning strategy to distribute mock yield to all participants
- **Real-time Updates**: Live vote tallies and pool statistics
- **Superhero Wallet Integration**: Seamless wallet connection and transaction signing

## 📋 Available Strategies

1. **🛡️ Safe Strategy** - 5% guaranteed yield, low risk
2. **🚀 Risky Strategy** - 15% potential yield, high risk  
3. **❤️ Charity Strategy** - 3% yield + community impact

Contributors vote each round (e.g., weekly) on the next allocation strategy. The most-voted strategy becomes the next epoch's investment route.

Mathematically, the **reward share** for each user can be represented as:
